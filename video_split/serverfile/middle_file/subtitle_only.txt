same as this line is connected to the
other ground
and this is the red led i'm using
um is connected to
ping 13 right now
and
that's a little bit of the um
of the um
breadboard connection um this is the um
esp client
and let me run the code real quick
so it will start running the code um and
it will first bring out the uh which
connected to which connected to my wi-fi
right now and the ip address is the
following and wait for around 30 seconds
and you will start printing out
and
the data out
yep and right now it's bringing the

so that's the demo for the um
for for the first esp client and
i'll put the rest of the data on the png
files
next i'd like to show you the esp server
